Title "Problem 1"

Introduction "# Problem 1

Let `a (n)` be a sequence that alternates between
`3 - 1 / n` and `1 + 1 / n`. Prove that this sequence diverges.

**Hint:** You may wish to argue using `N` that's slightly
larger than the smallest possible value.

**Hint 2:** If your desired `have` is a consequence of two facts put together, you can separate them by a semicolon. For example, if you know that `h : X = Y + Z`,
and you want to add a hypothesis `h' : |X - Y| = |Z|`, which is a combination of rewriting by `h` and a ring operation, then you can say:

`have h' : |X - Y| = |Z| := by rewrite [h]; ring_nf`.

This might come in handy!...
