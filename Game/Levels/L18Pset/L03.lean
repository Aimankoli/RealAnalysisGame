DisabledTheorem AntitoneLimitBound

/-- Prove `AntitoneLimitBound`
-/
Statement {a : ℕ → ℝ} (ha : Antitone a) {L : ℝ} (aLim : SeqLim a L) : ∀ n,
  L ≤ a n := by
by_contra h
push_neg at h
choose n0 hn0 using h
choose N hN using aLim (L - a n0) (by bound)
specialize hN (N + n0) (by bound)
rewrite [abs_lt] at hN
have hN' : a n0 < a (N + n0) := by linarith [hN.1]
have f1 : a (N+n0) ≤ a n0 := by apply ha (by bound)
linarith [f1, hN']
