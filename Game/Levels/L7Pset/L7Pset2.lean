Introduction "# Problem 2

Suppose that sequences `a b : ℕ → ℝ` converge to `L` and `M`, resp, with `L < M`. Show that
eventually, `a n < b n`.

/-- Prove the statement. -/
Statement (a b : ℕ → ℝ) (L M : ℝ) (ha : SeqLim a L) (hb : SeqLim b M) (hLM : L < M) :
  ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, a n < b n := by
have LneM : M - L ≠ 0 := by bound
have absML : 0 < |M - L| := by apply abs_pos_of_nonzero LneM
have MsubL : 0 ≤ M - L := by bound
have absMLeq : |M - L| = M - L := by apply abs_of_nonneg MsubL
have absML2 : 0 < |M - L| / 2 := by bound
specialize ha (|M - L| / 2) absML2
specialize hb (|M - L| / 2) absML2
choose N1 hN1 using ha
choose N2 hN2 using hb
use N1 + N2
intro n hn
have nN1 : N1 ≤ n := by bound
have nN2 : N2 ≤ n := by bound
specialize hN1 n nN1
specialize hN2 n nN2
rewrite [abs_lt, absMLeq] at hN1
rewrite [abs_lt, absMLeq] at hN2
linarith [hN1.2, hN2.1]

Conclusion "Done."
