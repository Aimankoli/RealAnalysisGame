Statement : ∃ g : ℝ → ℝ,
  FunDeriv (fun x ↦ x ^ 3) g := by
use (fun x ↦ 3 * x ^ 2)
intro x ε hε
let δ : ℝ := min 1 (ε / (3 * |x| + 1))
have δ_le1 : δ ≤ 1 := by bound
have δ_le2 : δ ≤ ε / (3 * |x| + 1) := by bound
have δpos : 0 < δ := by sorry
use δ, δpos
intro h hne hh
rewrite [show ((x + h) ^ 3 - x ^ 3) / h - 3 * x ^ 2 = (h - 0) * (3 * x + h) by field_simp; ring_nf]
rewrite [show |(h - 0) * (3 * x + h)| = |h - 0| * |3 * x + h| by apply abs_mul]
have h1 : |3 * x + h| ≤ 3 * |x| + 1 := by sorry
