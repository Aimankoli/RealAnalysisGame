# Lecture 20: Function Limits

**SIMPLICIO:** FUNCTIONS!!!

**SOCRATES:** Oh please don't shout, I'm standing right here.

**SIMPLICIO:** Sorry! I just got a little over excited that we're moving on to functions.
Please tell me about them!

**SOCRATES:** Ah, right. Very good. Let's start at the beginning. What's the first thing you
learn in Calculus?

**SIMPLICIO:** Hmmm. The derivative?

**SOCRATES:** Ok, we can see about starting there. Tell me, what does it mean to
compute the derivative of a function $f : \\R \\to \\R$ at some point $x = c$.

**SIMPLICIO:** Well, it's the slope of the tangent line.

**SOCRATES:** Yes, of course; I mean, what expression are you trying to evaluate?

**SIMPLICIO:** Oh! I remember: it's the limit as $h \\to 0$ of
$(f(x+h)-f(x)) / h$.

**SOCRATES:** Which word there is problematic?

**SIMPLICIO:** Ah, of course; \"limit\"! We don't know yet what limits are for functions. And I already know from experience that
you can't just stick in $h=0$, since both the numerator and denominator vanish.
