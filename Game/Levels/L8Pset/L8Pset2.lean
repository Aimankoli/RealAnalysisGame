Introduction "# Problem 2

We proved in class that `n < 2 ^ n`. It's even true that `n ^ 2 ≤ 2 ^ n`, but only for `n` sufficiently large (how large?).

Look at the problem statement. Note how we've implemented induction starting somewhere other than zero: by shifting the argument by that amount.

Hint: The result from Problem 1 might come in handy...
