Title "Lecture 6: Algebraic Limit Theorem, Part II"

Introduction "
# More on sequences

Welcome to Lecture 6, where we continue our deep dive into the fundamental theorems of real analysis.

This lecture focuses on two essential aspects of mathematical reasoning: **logical structure** and **practical techniques**. You'll master the fundamental logical operations that appear everywhere in mathematics—working with \"and\" statements, \"or\" statements, and the connections between them. These aren't just abstract logical exercises; they're the building blocks that make complex proofs manageable and clear.

**What You'll Accomplish:**

First, you'll develop fluency with Lean's logical tactics: constructing conjunctions with `split_ands`, making strategic choices with `left` and `right`, extracting information with dot notation, and handling case analysis with `cases'`. These form a complete toolkit for navigating the logical landscape of mathematical proof.

Then you'll apply these tools to prove one of the most elegant and powerful results in analysis: the **Squeeze Theorem**. This theorem beautifully demonstrates how logical reasoning and analytical insight combine to create mathematical magic. When you trap a sequence between two others that converge to the same limit, the trapped sequence has no choice but to converge there too!

**The Mathematical Journey:**

You'll see how the abstract logical operations you learn connect directly to concrete analytical reasoning. The same `split_ands` technique that helps you break down complex goals will help you extract bounds from convergence conditions. The `abs_lt` theorem will bridge the gap between absolute value statements and ordinary inequalities, giving you the tools to work with epsilon-N definitions effectively.

By the end of this lecture, you'll have not just learned individual techniques, but gained the ability to orchestrate them in sophisticated mathematical arguments. You're building the foundation for all of real analysis—and developing the logical clarity that distinguishes excellent mathematical reasoning from merely correct calculations.

Let's begin this journey from logical fundamentals to analytical mastery!
