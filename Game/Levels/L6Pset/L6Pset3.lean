Introduction "# Problem 3

You are given that a sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` converges to 5.
Prove that it is eventually positive.
"

/-- Prove the statement. -/
Statement (a : ℕ → ℝ) (ha : SeqLim a 5)
  : ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, 0 < a n := by
have f0 : (0 : ℝ) < 5 := by norm_num
specialize ha 5 f0
choose N hN using ha
use N
intro n hn
specialize hN n hn
rewrite [abs_lt] at hN
linarith [hN.1]

Conclusion "Done."
