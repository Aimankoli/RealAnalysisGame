Introduction "# Problem 5

You are given five sequences `a b c d e : ℕ → ℝ`, and you know that
`a`, `c`, and `e` converge to `L`, and that, for all `n`, `a n ≤ b n ≤ c n ≤ d n ≤ e n`.
Prove that both `b` and `d` also converge to `L`.

Conclusion "Done. (Hopefully you didn't do that by hand, but rather quoted -- twice -- a theorem that we recently proved?)"
