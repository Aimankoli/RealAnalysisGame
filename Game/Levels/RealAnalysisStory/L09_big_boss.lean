Title "Big Boss: The Ultimate Tactic Challenge"

Introduction "
# The Final Challenge

Congratulations! You've learned many fundamental tactics for mathematical reasoning in Lean:
- `exact hypothesisName` for when a hypothesis matches the goal exactly
- `rfl` for reflexivity (proving `X = X`)
- `rewrite [hypothesisName]` for rewriting using equalities
- `ring_nf` for algebraic manipulation
- `use` for providing witnesses to existence statements in goals
- `intro` for handling universal quantifiers in goals
- `specialize` for applying universal statements to specific values in hypotheses
- `choose value hypothesisOnValue using ExistentialHypothesis` for extracting information from existence statements in hypotheses

Here's a little \"Universal/Existential Quantifier Cheat Sheet\":

|           | ∀        | ∃      |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Goal**  | `intro`    | `use`    |
| **Hypothesis** | `specialize` | `choose` |

Now it's time for your first **Big Boss** - a problem that requires you to use almost ALL of these tactics in a single proof!

**World 1 Big Boss**
Given a function `f` and information about its behavior, prove a complex statement that involves existence, universals, algebra, and rewriting.

This is what real mathematical proofs look like - a careful orchestration of multiple reasoning steps. You've got this! Use everything you've learned.

**Extra Challenge**
If you want to really challenge yourself, play this level \"blind\". Write the goal down on paper, close the computer, solve it by hand, keeping track *in your mind* of what happens to the game board after each command, and only once you’ve worked it all out, open the computer and see if Lean accepts your solution.
Why would this be a good thing to do?

In general, I hope your *goal* in taking this course is to make your \"Real Analysis Brain Muscles\" stronger. By the end, you should be *really good* at
solving Real Analysis problems on paper, where you don't have Lean showing
you the Goal State after every move.
More broadly, the purpose of learning to solve Real Analysis problems is to learn to *think*, clearly, precisely. Strengthening your ability to work with pen and paper (or just mentally) directly transfers to research contexts where you're exploring ideas, sketching arguments, or presenting to others.

An LLM could easily work through all these Lean levels by pattern matching and logical manipulation - just as you could solve multiplication problems by plugging them into a calculator instead of memorizing your times tables. But that completely defeats the purpose of the exercise, which is to rewire your brain and build mathematical intuition. It's like deciding you want to bench press 200 pounds, loading up the bar, and then using a forklift to lift it for you while you stand underneath - you might have moved the weight, but you haven't gotten any stronger. The real value isn't in producing correct proofs (though that's nice), it's in the cognitive transformation that happens when you struggle through the reasoning yourself, building the mental pathways that let you see mathematical structure intuitively.

/-- **BIG BOSS LEVEL**: This problem requires all the tactics you've learned! -/
Statement (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h_existential : ∃ (a : ℝ), f (a) = 3) (h_universal : ∀ x > 0, f (x + 1) = f (x) + 9) :

  -- Step 1: Extract the witness from the existence hypothesis
  choose a ha using h_existential
  -- Step 2: We'll use a as our witness for b
  use a
  -- Step 3: Introduce the universal quantifier
  intro y
  intro hy
  -- Step 4: Apply the universal property to our specific value a
  specialize h_universal y hy

Conclusion "
# 🎉 VICTORY! 🎉

**Incredible!** You've defeated the Big Boss and mastered all the fundamental tactics of mathematical reasoning!

**Let's see what you just accomplished:**

1. **`choose a ha using h_existential`** - Extracted the witness `a` and fact that `f (a) = 3` from the hypothesis
2. **`use a`** - Chose `a` as your witness for the existence statement in the goal
3. **`intro y hy`** - Handled the universal quantifier \"for all y > 0\" in the goal
4. **`specialize h_universal y hy`** - Applied the universal property to your specific value in the hypothesis
5. **`rewrite [h_universal]`** - Used the specialized fact to rewrite the goal
6. **`rewrite [ha]`** - Used the original fact that `f (a) = 3` to also rewrite the goal
7. **`ring_nf`** - Verified finally that `(f y + 9) ^ 2 = (f y + 3 ^ 2) ^ 2`

You've just completed a genuinely sophisticated mathematical argument! This kind of multi-step reasoning, combining existence statements, universal properties, and algebraic manipulation, is exactly what you'll encounter throughout real analysis.

**You are now ready to begin your journey to rigorous calculus!**
