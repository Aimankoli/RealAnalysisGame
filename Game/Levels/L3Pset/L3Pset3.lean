Introduction "# Problem 3

Determine what the limit of the sequence `1 / n ^ 2` is, and prove it.

Hints you may find useful:
- We have yet to learn about dealing with the square-root function.
So see if you can be even lazier in your choice of parameters...
- If you know that `h : 0 < N` holds in the *natural* numbers, then you can prove that that `1 ≤ N` simply by `apply`ing `h`, that is: `have h' : 1 ≤ N := by apply h`. (This would not work for an inequality in the real numbers, since it's in general not true!)

Statement (a : ℕ → ℝ) (ha : ∀ n, a n = 1 / n ^ 2) :
    ∃ L, SeqLim a L := by
use 0
intro ε hε
choose N hN using ArchProp hε
have OneOverε : 0 < 1 / ε := by bound
have Npos : (0 : ℝ) < N := by linarith [hN, OneOverε]

use N
intro n hn
specialize ha n
rewrite [ha]
have f1 : (1 : ℝ) / n ^ 2 - 0 = 1 / n ^ 2 := by ring_nf
rewrite [f1]
have f2 : |(1 : ℝ) / n ^ 2| = 1 / n ^ 2 := by bound
rewrite [f2]
have hn' : (N : ℝ) ≤ n := by exact_mod_cast hn
have f3 : (0 : ℝ) < n := by linarith [Npos, hn']
field_simp
have Npos' : 0 < N := by exact_mod_cast Npos
have NgeOne : 1 ≤ N := by apply Npos'
have NgeOne' : (1 : ℝ) ≤ N := by exact_mod_cast NgeOne
have f4 : 1 < ε * N * N := by bound
have f5 : ε * N * N ≤ ε * n * n := by bound
linarith [f4, f5]

Conclusion "Done."
