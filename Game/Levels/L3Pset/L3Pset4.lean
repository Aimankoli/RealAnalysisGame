Introduction "# Problem 4

Here's an even more involved limit problem. We've had luck getting `bound` to prove `|X| ≤ X`, especially when there's a hypothesis `h : 0 ≤ X` already available in the list of assumptions. But I've found it not to be reliable, unfortunately. So let me give you one more theorem for your toolchest.

## New Theorem: `abs_of_nonneg`.
If you have a hypothesis `h : 0 ≤ X` in your toolchest,
then you can prove that `|X| = X` via:

`have factName : |X| = X := by apply abs_of_nonneg h`.

/--
Usage: given hypothesis `h : 0 ≤ X`, you can prove: `have : |X| = X := by apply abs_of_nonneg h`
