Introduction "# Problem 2

Prove that the sequence `(n + 1) / n` has a limit, say, `L`, and determine what it is.

We haven't yet learned a good way to use the theorem `OneOverNLimZero`
that we already proved, so just adapt the proof of that, rather than trying to quote it. (It's good practice!)

Statement (a : ℕ → ℝ) (ha : ∀ n, a n = (n + 1) / n) :
    ∃ L, SeqLim a L := by
use 1
intro ε hε
choose N hN using ArchProp hε
use N
intro n hn
specialize ha n
rewrite [ha]
have : 0 < 1 / ε := by bound
have Npos : (0 : ℝ) < N := by linarith [hN, this]
have : (N : ℝ) ≤ n := by exact_mod_cast hn
have : (0 : ℝ) < n := by linarith [this, Npos]
have : ((n : ℝ) + 1) / n - 1 = 1 / n := by field_simp; ring_nf

Conclusion "Done."
