Title "Lecture 2: Newton's Computation of π"

Introduction "
# The Mathematical Revolution of 1666

Now that you've mastered the basic tactics of mathematical reasoning, let's dive into the story that will motivate everything we do in real analysis.

This world tells the tale of Newton's amazing calculation of π - how a 23-year-old genius, quarantining at home from Cambridge due to an outbreak of the plague, transformed a mysterious geometric constant into an infinite series of easily obtained fractions. But more importantly, we'll see how this brilliant calculation exposed almost **every major foundational problem in mathematics**  at the time.

Newton's method worked spectacularly. But it rested on three enormous assumptions that neither he nor anyone else in his day could fully justify:

## The Three Great Questions

**1. Infinite Series Convergence**
- When does an infinite sum actually converge?
- What does \"converge\" even mean, precisely?
- When a series is a function of $x$, like a power series, how do we figure out for which values of $x$ is does the limit exist?

**2. Function Representation**
- If the limit does exist, what, if anything, can we say about what kind of function it is? Is it continuous? Differentiable?
- When does pointwise convergence preserve these properties?

**3. Interchange of Limits**
- Newton's π calculation required swapping an integral with an infinite sum. But an integral is itself a limit; so really, he's swapping to limits. When can such an interchange be justified?
- This leads us to one of the **fundamental problem of analysis**: when do limiting processes commute?

## The Historical Crisis

Newton's generation had the computational power to work miracles, but lacked the theoretical foundations to understand why their methods worked. They could calculate π, logarithms, and solve differential equations - but couldn't fully prove their techniques were valid.

This crisis persisted for **200 years** until mathematicians like Cauchy, Bolzano, Riemann, and Weierstrass developed the rigorous theory of limits, convergence, and continuity that we'll study in this course.
