Title "The Binomial Theorem"

Introduction "
# The Binomial Theorem

We are quite far from being able to prove anything like
Newton's Binomial Theorem, but
we can
already
 learn more proof techniques and Lean principles
by going over a proof of the standard Binomial Theorem.
Let's build up to it.

/- The `add_pow` theorem states the binomial theorem in full generality -/
--TheoremDoc add_pow

/-- Now let's see the same mathematics in formal notation -/
Statement (x y : ℝ) (n : ℕ) :
  (x + y)^n = ∑ m ∈ Finset.range (n + 1), x^m * y^(n - m) * ↑(n.choose m) := by
  Hint (hidden := true) "This is exactly `add_pow` - use `exact add_pow x y n`."

Conclusion "
# Two Languages, Same Mathematics

Perfect! You've just seen that **formal mathematical language** and **informal mathematical intuition** express exactly the same ideas.

## What You've Learned

**Concrete verification**: $(x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3$ ✓

**Formal statement**: $(x+y)^n = \\sum_{m=0}^{n} x^m y^{n-m} \\binom{n}{m}$ ✓

**Equivalence**: The formal sum `∑ m ∈ Finset.range 4, x^m * y^(3 - m) * ↑(3.choose m)` expands to exactly the concrete expression ✓

## Why This Matters

Newton was about to **generalize** the binomial theorem in ways that had never been attempted:
- What if the exponent $n$ is **negative**?
- What if $n$ is a **fraction** like $1/2$?
- What if we allow **infinite sums**?

The informal notation $(x+y)^n$ becomes ambiguous in these cases. But the formal approach will let us state **precisely** what Newton meant by his revolutionary generalizations.

## The Journey Ahead

In the next level, you'll see Newton take his first dangerous step: extending the binomial theorem to **negative exponents**. This is where the solid ground of finite algebra gives way to the quicksand of infinite processes...

**The key insight**: Formal mathematics doesn't make things more complicated - it makes subtle ideas **precise** enough to be safely explored.

Welcome to Newton's mathematical adventure!
