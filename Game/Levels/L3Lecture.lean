Introduction "
# More on sequences

In Lecture 2, we learned the definition of a sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` converging to a limit `L`: for any tolerance
`ε > 0`, there exists a time `N`, so that, for any point after that time, `n ≥ N`, we are within the tolerance, `|a n - L| < ε`.

We also learned how to do something completely trivial with it, namely, show that the constant sequence converges, with that constant as its limit.

Let's step it up a notch, shall we?
