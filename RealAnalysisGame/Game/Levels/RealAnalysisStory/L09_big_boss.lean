Title "Big Boss: The Ultimate Tactic Challenge"

Introduction "
# The Final Challenge

Congratulations! You've learned many fundamental tactics for mathematical reasoning in Lean:
- `exact hypothesisName` for when a hypothesis matches the goal exactly
- `rfl` for reflexivity (proving `X = X`)
- `rw [hypothesisName]` for rewriting using equalities
- `ring_nf` for algebraic manipulation
- `use` for providing witnesses to existence statements in goals
- `intro` for handling universal quantifiers in goals
- `specialize` for applying universal statements to specific values in hypotheses
- `obtain ⟨value, hypothesisOnValue⟩ := ExistentialHypothesis ` for extracting information from existence statements in hypotheses

Now it's time for your first **Big Boss** - a problem that requires you to use almost ALL of these tactics in a single proof!

**The Challenge:**
Given a function `f` and information about its behavior, prove a complex statement that involves existence, universals, algebra, and rewriting.

This is what real mathematical proofs look like - a careful orchestration of multiple reasoning steps. You've got this! Use everything you've learned.

/-- **BIG BOSS LEVEL**: This problem requires all the tactics you've learned! -/
Statement (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h_existential : ∃ (a : ℝ), f (a) = 3) (h_universal : ∀ x > 0, f (x + 1) = f (x) + 9) :
  ∃ (b : ℝ), ∀ y > 0, f (y + 1)^2 = (f (y) + (f b)^2)^2 := by
  -- Step 1: Extract the witness from the existence hypothesis
  obtain ⟨a, ha⟩ := h_existential
  -- Step 2: We'll use a as our witness for b
  use a
  -- Step 3: Introduce the universal quantifier
  intro y
  intro hy
  -- Step 4: Apply the universal property to our specific value a
  specialize h_universal y hy
  -- Step 5: Rewrite using what we learned about g(a + 1)
  rw [h_universal]
  -- Step 6: Rewrite using what we know about g(a)
  rw [ha]
  -- Step 7: Simplify the algebra
  ring_nf

Conclusion "
# 🎉 VICTORY! 🎉

**Incredible!** You've defeated the Big Boss and mastered all the fundamental tactics of mathematical reasoning!

**Let's see what you just accomplished:**

1. **`obtain ⟨a, ha⟩ := h_existential`** - Extracted the witness `a` and fact that `f (a) = 3` from the hypothesis
2. **`use a`** - Chose `a` as your witness for the existence statement in the goal
3. **`intro y` and `intro hy`** - Handled the universal quantifier \"for all y > 0\" in the goal
4. **`specialize h_universal y hy`** - Applied the universal property to your specific value in the hypothesis
5. **`rw [h_universal]`** - Used the specialized fact to rewrite the goal
6. **`rw [ha]`** - Used the original fact that `f (a) = 3` to also rewrite the goal
7. **`ring_nf`** - Verified finally that `(f y + 9) ^ 2 = (f y + 3 ^ 2) ^ 2`

You've just completed a genuinely sophisticated mathematical argument! This kind of multi-step reasoning, combining existence statements, universal properties, and algebraic manipulation, is exactly what you'll encounter throughout real analysis.

**You are now ready to begin your journey to rigorous calculus!**
