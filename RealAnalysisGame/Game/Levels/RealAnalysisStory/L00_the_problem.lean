Title "The Real Numbers: Obviously Obvious"

Introduction "
# At First, Everything Seemed Clear



This number line satisfied \"obvious\" properties kids learn in grade school:

**Commutativity:** 3 + 5 = 5 + 3 and 3 × 5 = 5 × 3

**Associativity:** 3 + (5 + 6) = (3 + 5) + 6 and 3 × (5 × 6) = (3 × 5) × 6

**Distributive Law:** 3 × (5 + 6) = 3 × 5 + 3 × 6

Nobody questioned these. They were just... true.



For millennia, people thought they understood what the \"real numbers\" were. Then mathematics grew too big for its foundations, and everything fell apart.

This course has three mathematical goals, resolving the great crises of the 19th century:

**(1) Construction of the real numbers** (by Cauchy sequences), and proving their basic properties (commutativity, associativity, and the distributive law, which will no longer be obvious!)

**(2) A corrected statement and rigorous proof** of Cauchy's claim that limits of continuous functions are continuous

**(3) A rigorous proof** of Fourier's claim about sines and cosines

We'll take a scenic route to these goals, as our interests and tastes dictate.

**Begin with \"Level 0: The Story of Real Analysis\"** to understand why we need all this rigor.




For Millennia, Everything Was Clear

For thousands of years, people understood what the \"real numbers\" were:
the number line, with whole numbers, fractions, irrational square roots, etc.

Conclusion "
Everything was peaceful in the mathematical world.

The real numbers were the number line. Addition and multiplication worked
the way they always had. Mathematics was built on solid, obvious foundations.

**Then came the 17th century...**

**Next:** Newton and Leibniz ignite a revolution.
