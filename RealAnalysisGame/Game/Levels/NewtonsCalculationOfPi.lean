Title "Newton's Calculation of π"

Introduction "
# The Story Behind the Mathematics

Before we dive into rigorous proofs, let's follow Newton's original 1666 calculation
of π step by step. This informal walkthrough will motivate everything we do later.

We'll see exactly how Newton:
- Connected π to a simple geometric area
- Used the binomial theorem to create infinite series
- Integrated term by term to get π

By the end, you'll understand both the genius and the gaps in Newton's approach—
and why mathematicians like Cauchy had to invent ε-δ calculus 150 years later.

**This world contains no proofs—just the story of an amazing calculation.**
