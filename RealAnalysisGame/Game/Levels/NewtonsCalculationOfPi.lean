Title "Newton's π Computation"

Introduction "
# The Mathematical Revolution of 1666

Now that you've mastered the basic tactics of mathematical reasoning, let's dive into the story that will motivate everything we do in real analysis.

This world tells the tale of Newton's amazing π computation - how a 23-year-old genius transformed a geometric constant into an infinite series. But more importantly, we'll see how this brilliant calculation exposed the shaky foundations of mathematics.

Newton's method worked, but we did not have the tools to rigorously prove *why*, until the late 19th century.

**You'll learn:**
- How Newton actually computed π using infinite series
- Why his method was both brilliant and problematic
- How this connects to the foundational issues we'll resolve later

This is the story behind the story - the mathematical revolution that made real analysis necessary.
